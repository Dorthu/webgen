# webgen

Generate static webpages from content loaders.

### Concept

Point nginx to the output directory, drop loaders into loaders/, cron it up.

### Why?

I was kinda meh on jekyll and wanted to pull a feed from a bunch of sources?  nih?

### This is not generic at all

It probably will become generic though.  Like, if the world needs another static site
generator.
